<p>
    Piper integrates external tools and command-line programs into Burp Suite through configurable pipelines. The
    extension passes HTTP requests and responses to external programs and feeds the execution results back into Burp,
    enabling Unix-style tool composition without writing Java extensions.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Add custom message viewers that format HTTP content using external programs (e.g., render Protobuf with <code
            class="InlineCode">protoc</code>)</li>
    <li>Generate and process Intruder payloads with external tools like John the Ripper or custom scripts</li>
    <li>Highlight and comment on proxy items based on output from command-line programs (e.g., hash requests with <code
            class="InlineCode">sha256sum</code>)</li>
    <li>Transform HTTP messages with custom encryption or encoding through external Python scripts</li>
    <li>Invoke external tools from context menus, such as diff utilities for comparing requests</li>
    <li>Configure tool pipelines in any language that accepts stdin input or command-line parameters</li>
    <li>Export and import configurations in YAML format for sharing and reuse</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Open the Piper tab and configure a tool by specifying its command line and integration type (message viewer,
        commentator, highlighter, context menu item, payload generator, payload processor, HTTP listener, or macro)</li>
    <li>Enable the configuration using the toggle button in the interface</li>
    <li>Access the integration from the relevant Burp context (e.g., Proxy History for commentators and highlighters,
        message editor tabs for custom viewers, Intruder for payload tools)</li>
    <li>View output in the designated location based on tool type: comments appear in Proxy History, message viewers add
        new editor tabs, and HTTP listeners transform messages in transit</li>
    <li>Optionally export configurations to YAML files for sharing</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Review imported configurations carefully before enabling them.</p>
